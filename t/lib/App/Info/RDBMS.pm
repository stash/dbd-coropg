App::Info::RDBMS - Information about databases on a system

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an abstract base class for App::Info subclasses that provide
information about relational databases. Its subclasses are required to
implement its interface. See L<App::Info|App::Info> for a complete description
and L<App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL|App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL> for an example
implementation.

=head1 INTERFACE

Currently, App::Info::RDBMS adds no more methods than those from its parent
class, App::Info.
