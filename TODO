- Use WITH HOLD for cursor work
- Devise a way to automatically create ppm for Windows builds
- I8N docs and error messages
- Change quote and dequote functions to take Sv instead of string so that
   things like arrays can be serialized by the quote function.  This will
   take care of broken chopblanks and pg_bool_tf (pass the quote/dequote 
   options struct to function quote/dequote functions)
- Allow user callbacks to quote user-defined types
- Move to the Module::Build system
- Test heavily with a thread-enabled Perl
- Remove libpq dependency
- Handle and/or better tests for different encoding, especially those not 
   supported as a server encoding (e.g. BIG5)
- Support passing hashrefs in and out for custom types.
- Support a flag for behind-the-scenes CURSOR to emulate partial fetches.
- Handle unicode conversion better and perhaps eliminate the need for 
  the pg_enable_utf8 attribute.
- Fix this: http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2698430
- Composite type support: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/rowtypes.html
