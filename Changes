    passed to the function if you expect this might happen.
    (CPAN bug #30924) [GSM]

    strings from ruining the prepare. UTF-16 may still cause problems.

  - Notice messages generated by the database now use the perl 
    warning mechanism instead of going to stderr.
    [Dominic Mitchell <dom@semantico.com>]
  - $dbh->prepare() rewrites the SQL statement into an internal form,
    striping out comments and whitespace, and if PostgreSQL > 7.3 takes the 
    stripped statement and passes that to Postgres' PREPARE statement, 
    then rewrites the statement as 'EXECUTE "DBD::PG::cached_query n"
    ($1, $2, ... $n, $n+1)' for DBD::Pg's execute.
    -- Currently disabled until PREPARE works a little better
  - Allows the use of :n and :foo bind params. So: 
    (SELECT * FROM foo WHERE 1 = :this and 2 = :that) will now work.
  - Complains on execute when unbound bind params are submitted
    (instead of defaulting to NULL)
  - Switched over to use driver.xst.
  - pg_error() removes \n's rather than truncating the message on the first \n.
  - Fixed statement scan problem where the preparse of
    "SELECT foo[3:33] from bar" was scanning :33 as a placeholder
  - Moved the quoting of bind values out of execute() and into
    bind -- as there is no need to requote the value every time execute 
    is called.
  - :veryverylongplaceholdername == Long walk, short pier -- fixed.
  - quote() is now in C and uses same code as bind_param.
  - Quoting and dequoting now use libpq quoting functions where available
    (I still need to take the libpq functions swiped out of quote.c and move 
    it into libpqswip.c with license info &c., and switch ifndefs to ifdefs)
  - bind_param() will convert from 1,0 to TRUE/FALSE when pg_type
    is PGBOOLOID.
  - Fixed many heap buffer overruns.
  - Added support for the get_info() method [GSM]
  - Added tests for POD validation [Mark Stosberg]
  - Several improvements to column_info, including:
    - Fixed column_info so NULLABLE field shows correctly. [kevin@sysexperts.com]
    - REMARKS field works now [Mark Stosberbg]
    - COLUMN_DEF fixed
    - COLUMN_SIZE fixed
    - pg_constraint column added to display column constraints

    db connection fails. [GSM]

    rather than files. Contributed by Garth Webb.

    make sure that they work. These are exportable via 
    "use DBD::Pg qw(:pg_types);". [David Wheeler]
  - Deprecated the undocumented (and invalid) use of SQL_BINARY in
    bind_param() and documented the correct approach: "bind_param($num,
    $val { pg_type => PG_BYTEA });". Use of SQL_BINARY in bind_param() will
    now issue a warning if $h->{Warn} is true. [David Wheeler]
  - Removed invalid (and broken) support for SQL_BINARY in quote().
    [David Wheeler]
  - Added App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL to the distribution (but it won't
    be installed) to help Makefile.PL find the PostgreSQL include and
    library files. [David Wheeler]
