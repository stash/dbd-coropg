This is a hacked version of DBD::Pg that uses Coro & AnyEvent to make it
non-blocking.  It is *not* ready for production.

It currently cannot be installed at the same time as the regular DBD::Pg, so
this won't be going to CPAN just yet.  When it does, I expect it will be named
DBD-CoroPg so that it can be properly installable.

Sincerely,
